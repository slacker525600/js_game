planning on making a little game outlined on my blog 
http://meanderingmadman.blogspot.com/2013/06/100-steps.html

finger no longer broken, but I think my keyboard may not have liked having a little banging on it 
put in a few hours today
got basic main map working to some degree, 
starting to outline basic actions
reformulated some thoughts. but ... still spitballing.
